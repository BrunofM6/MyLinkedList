# MyLinkedList
## What is this?
Project where I create a linked list in C. Small system to play with linked lists and demonstrate understanding in memory management, the linked list data structure and some fun optimal operations in linked lists, pointers and structs.

### Implemented functions
At first you are greeted to a console and you are assumed to be playing with a single linked list that starts empty. The linked list is NULL terminated in order to signify the end of the list and that is demonstrated in the print, so, when empty, only the NULL identifier appears. Last object of list always points to NULL. You can add/remove tail, head, or element at n (index starts at 0) position. You can also clear the list. It is memory safe and efficient. To implement a more useful linked list, simply add data to the struct as it fits your needs.
